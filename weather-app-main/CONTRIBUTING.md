## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, track issues, and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively accept your  pull requests:

1. Star this repository.
2. Create an issue with a description and wait for the approval.
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs through Github [issues] (https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)We use GitHub issues to track publicly available bugs.Report a bug by [opening a new issue] (https://github.com/avinash201199/To-Do-List/issues/new); it's as simple as that!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
